# React + Vite

In order to see the code in localhost, open terminal, execute npm nstall and npm run dev. I'm using vite.

The single-page application uses React and tailwindcss. In addition, i used libraries like react-modal for authentication, react-router-dom, react-dom. 

!IMPORTANT:
design and svg folders are not implemented by me. I found it on internet and downloaded. Colour classes and tailwind plugins mostly for colors were not implemented by me. I generated most photos by AI tools like pxlr.com and then I modified them.
